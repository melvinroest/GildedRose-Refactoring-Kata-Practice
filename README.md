To run use: `npm test` as there is only one user of this particular app, all the testcases! üòÑ

My solution is to be found at: `gilded_rose.js`

Link to the challenge: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

`gilded_rose_original.js` is slightly altered. I altered the Shop constructor, since the requirements kind of specify that an item cannot have a quality of or more, which I also interpreted as that it cannot be instantialized as 50 or more (unless it's an exception to the rule). Other than that is completely similar, if you get nervous by my messy way of working reference: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata/blob/master/js-jasmine/src/gilded_rose.js

**Sounds fun and all but why would I want to do this?**

Good question! In this kata, I have noticed that I was busy with the following:
* Writing tests (that do not feel arbitrary or useless)
* Software design / refactoring / code readability
* Understanding spaghetti code

I was not busy with the following:
* Solving a hard problem through programming (software design / refactoring feels distinctly different)
* Algorithms
* Performance

**How could I get most out of this?**

Find a buddy and do the exercise together and discuss the solution.

**How long is this Q&A going to last?**

As long as I want to.

**Ah c'mon! Really?**

Okay, I'll stop. I'll set you free! ‚ù§Ô∏è
